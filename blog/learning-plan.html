      <h5 class="para">
        My long long term goal is to start a tech company in finance industry. However, by the end of next year,
        I'm hoping to move up from junior/graduate level. I also want to mentor young developers in the future.

      <h4>
        Biggest strengths and limitations
      </h4>
      <h5 class="para">
        My biggest strength will still be having a passion in learning. I like learning new things and seeing how other people think. This will help
        me a lot through bootcamp to improve myself. The biggest limitation is that I tend to ignore any obstacles 
        I come across and I'm hoping to stop this by facing difficulties and asking for help.

      <h4>
        Biggest non-technical challenge
      </h4>
      <h5 class="para">
        I'm not good at public speaking, and I hate it but I also know it's an important skill to have.

        What human skills would I like to see developed?
      </h4>

        Expectations from the Bootcamp team
      </h4>
      <h5 class="para">
        An impossible expectation is having a 24/7 hotline (lol). I want to have more of code-along workshops since
        I really enjoyed them during Foundations. Other expectations are receiving regular feedback and harsh 
        words sometimes! 
      </h5>

      <h4>
        Expectations of myself on Bootcamp
      </h4>
      <h5 class="para">
        I expect myself to be motivated, focused and always be willing to learn and try out different things. 
        I will have a regular day-to-day pattern, stay fit and healthy. Acknowledge when I'm stressed and/or 
        stressed. I'm also expecting to make more friends!

        tech company. In about 5 years time, I want to join a start-up company and help them achieve their 
        goals. I'm also planning to work overseas in 5 years time.
