        <h4>
          3 new things I have learnt about myself and my ego
        </h4>
        <h5 class="para">
          That I don't really share my feelings and tend to prioritise learning over what I'm going
          through emotionally. Second thing is that through neuroplasticity blog, I am able to trust 
          myself more and "what I put in is what I get". The last thing, and not proud, I have learnt about myself is 
          that I lack in compassion. This was actually a bit shocking becuase I thought I was 
          compasisonate and a good listener. 
        </h5>

        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h4>
        <h5 class="para">	
          I personally think that empathy and self-awareness play a big role in learning. Strengthening
          empathy to myself and others has taught me that we, as a whole cohort, go through the same
          thing in the journey of becoming a programmer and better humans. Through learning self-awareness
          I was able to ask more questions - this might not sound like a big thing, but in school I was
          never able to ask questions and tended to look for answers myself. By asking (or posting) questions
          I was able to see different ways to solve a problem and that my approach was not "wrong". I am 
          now more able to focus on myself and be confident of the things I don't know. 
        </h5>


        <h4>
          What surprise me the most about the core learning? 
        </h4>
        <h5 class="para">
          I didn't know core learning was a big part of learning and programming. I am surprised how 
          deep Dev Academy touches core learning and keep reminding to look after ourselves
          as well focusing on strenthening human skills. 
        </h5>

        <h4>
          The most challenging aspects of core learning?
        </h4>
        <h5 class = "para">
          The most challenging part of core learning was being true to my feelings and having them written
          down in words. As mentioned before, I don't share my deep feelings and having to write them down
          was a challenging and often difficult. 
        </h5>

        <h4> 
          Why do I think Dev spends so much time focusing on core learning?
        </h4>
        <h5 class = "para">
          I didn't really understand the quote "To be a good programmer, study code. To be a grea one, study people"
          in the beginning of Foundations but now I think why core learning is important in learning. To
          improve empathy and communication skills is an important aspects in working environment, and most 
          importantly in life. Core learning taught me how to think about how things work and taught me how
          to be a better problem-solver. 
        </h5>

        <h4>
          Does the time I spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?
        </h4>
        <h5 class = "para"> 
          Personally, I would've liked less time writing core blogs, just because I had a difficult time
          writing them and often spent too much time thinking about them. However without core blogs
          I don't think I would've been able to reflect on my learning and focusing on myself. I enjoyed
          learning core as much as tech.
