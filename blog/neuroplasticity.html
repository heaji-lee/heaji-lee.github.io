      <h4>Understanding neuroplasticity and its benefits to people</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">Neuroplasticity refers to "the brain's ability to modify, change, and adapt
        both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience".
        Some studies have shown that the brains aren't in a fixed form, but rather 
        are malleable throughout life. Understanding this, people understand 
        that there are no limits in absorbing or studying new information and
        are more resilient. 
      </h5>
      <h4>Engage with neuroplaticity for my benefit</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">I used to think that my brain has a set capacity and that I could not "take
        in" more information than the capacity. With the fact my brain has unlimited space to store information, I can push my limits. </h5>
      <h4>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">Practice makes permanent. Repeat an activity over and over help you to build stronger relationship with the activity and you become more comfortable doing them. Keep reminding yourself you are capable of unlimited things will make you more motivated. Embrace the fact that you don't know an information or how to do a certain thing and focus on improving them. </h5>

      <h4>What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">Growth mindset is knowing that you can improve your skills with practice and enough effort. The saying "know your limits" does not apply to growth mindset as limits don't exist in improving your skills. Understanding that abilities can be developed is important so you don't get trapped in a box saying "Oh, you can't do this" or "Oh, you'll never be as good as this or that person"</h5>
      <h4>Did anything surprise me? Change for me?</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">Yes, there were multiples times that I thought to myself, I'll never be as good as this student in the cohort and felt my limits. After research I believe that if I "just do it" I will be able to reach the level that I once looked upon.</h5>
      <h4>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">Having an opened minset that I am capable of new things when I put my time and effort. </h5>

      </h5>
      <h4>Reflect and Discuss</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">I'm trying my best not to compare myself to anyone else and remind myself that everyone has different learning pace.</h5>

      <h4>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">It felt good knowing that someone really knows how I feel and can empathise. It felt like 
        I could trust the person.
      </h5>
      <h4>What was it like to fully listen?</h4>
      <h5 class = "para">I noticed that I was hearing every word they said and could feel any emotions they were 
        going through.
