        <h2>When was I blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>
          The problem was when I couldn't understand the concept of FizzBuzz question. I had to   
          google similar questions and see the questions students posted on Discord. Throughout the process
          I didn't understand why I didn't get it in the first place but felt very achieving. I learnt 
          that actually understanding the concept 100% before starting really helps. 
        </p>

        <h2>CWhen did I elegantly solve a problem</h2>
        <p>
          Doing deBee challenge in Built-In Methods. I was able to do this very quickly, thanks to Google.
          I felt so achieving that I thought I was like a coding genius. I learnt that Google is the best
          resource and that I was capable. 
        </p>

        <h2>How confident I feel using different problem-solving techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Pseudocode, console.log-ging and googling are the techniques that I find the most comfortable. 
          Pseudocode really helped throughout the exercises and simply "brain-storming" what I was about to do. 
          I used a lot of console.log-ging as well to see if I'm on the right track. Googling, of course, has been 
          very helpful too because I know that I am not the only one stuck on a similar problem and some resources
          on Google explained concepts well. Rubber ducky method, I'm not really comfortable using this because 
          I do not like saying out loud what the problem is because it would then turn into a reality (I know I'm
          weird). Reading error messages were helpful but sometimes I didn't know what the error exactly was. 
          Asking my peers and coaches for help definitely made me re-think of a question and kind of get back on the 
          right track. As I'm writing this blog, I'm reflecting on how I learn and what ways work the best for me 
          whenever I am stuck.
