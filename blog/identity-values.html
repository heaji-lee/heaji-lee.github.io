        <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
        <h5 class="para">I could not come up with a recent situation like this</h5>
        <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
        <h5 class="para">	Growing up my mum taught me the importance of being polite and kind to others. It was natural for me to surround myself with people that have the same values as mine. I have known my best friends for about 15 years and because we were too young to figure out our identities, we were able to build the same values and morals.</h4>
        <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
        <h5 class="para">	I am passionate for new experiences and challenges. I come up with creative ideas when solving problems. These strengths will help me to stay interested, excited and keeping learning fun.</h5>
        <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
        <h5 class="para">	I can get bored easily and tend to lose focus whenever I get stuck. Because developing is constant learning, I’m afraid that I might lose interest in learning new concepts.</h5>
        <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
        <h5 class="para">	Group projects at uni. I usually take time to get my mind clear when it comes to conflicts or situations where there are resistance or tension. I try to be rational rather than emotional. I used to go along with the decisions made by others. Now I want to be more assertive and proactive tosay what I really think is right and how it’ll help the team achieve the goals.
