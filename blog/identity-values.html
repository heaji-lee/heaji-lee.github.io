        <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <h3 class="white">•	Growing up my mum taught me the importance of being polite and kind to others. It was natural for me to surround myself with people that have the same values as mine. I have known my best friends for about 15 years and because we were too young to figure out our identities, we were able to build the same values and morals.</h3>

        <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
        <h3 class="white">•	I can get bored easily and tend to lose focus whenever I get stuck. Because developing is constant learning, I’m afraid that I might lose interest in learning new concepts.</h3>

        <h3 class="white">•	Group projects at uni. I usually take time to get my mind clear when it comes to conflicts or situations where there are resistance or tension. I try to be rational rather than emotional. I used to go along with the decisions made by others. Now I want to be more assertive and proactive tosay what I really think is right and how it’ll help the team achieve the goals.
